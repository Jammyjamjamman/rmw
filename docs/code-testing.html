<p>The easiest way is to use the tests built into 'make'. See
<a href="https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/tree/master/test">test/README</a>
for instructions. To learn the "inner-workings" of rmw, continue
reading this page.</p>

<h3>Method 1</h3>
<p>By default (specified in the config file) rmw will not perform
  operations on your regular Trash folder; the configuration option for
  that is</p>
<p class="w3-panel">$HOME/.trash.rmw</p>

<p>rmw will create that folder and your personal configuration file
  ($HOME/.config/rmw/config) the first time it's run.</p>

<p>One method of testing is to change the HOME environmental variable
  at run time. At the command line, use:</p>

<p class="w3-panel">
  HOME=$PWD rmw
</p>

<p>(use `./rmw` if the program is not yet in your PATH)</p>

<p>rmw would detect your home directory as your present working directory,
  and would create the necessary directories. Now create a blank file:
</p>

<p class="w3-panel">
  touch tempfile
</p>

<p>And then remove it to your temporary rmw trash folder:</p>

<p class="w3-panel">
  HOME=$PWD rmw tempfile
</p>

<p>
  tempfile would be moved to $PWD/.trash.rmw/files, and a `.trashinfo`
  file will be created in $PWD/.trash.rmw/info. The format of the
  .trashinfo file is the same that your Desktop trash uses:
</p>

<p class="w3-panel">
  [Trash Info]
  Path=/home/andy/src/rmw/tempfile
  DeletionDate=2017-11-17T13:44:04a
</p>

<p>Now try</p>
<p class="w3-panel">
  HOME=$PWD rmw -u
</p>

<p>You'll see that tempfile has been restored to its original
  location.</p>

<h3>Method 2</h3>

<p>The following method is a little more complex</p>

<p>In rmw.h, change DATA_DIR</p>
<p class="w3-panel">
  `#define DATA_DIR "/testing/.config/testrmw"`
</p>

<p>Then build it.</p>

<p>Run the rebuilt binary to create that folder. Then copy '/etc/rmwrc'
  (if it's not there, try /usr/local/etc/ or the rmw source directory
  (./etc)) into it, and rename the newly-placed 'rmwrc' to 'config'.</p>

<p>Add a WASTE folder to the top of 'config', such as
  WASTE=$HOME/testing/.local/share/Trash.test</p>

<p>Comment out any other WASTE folders.</p>

<p class="w3-panel">
  `~: mkdir $HOME/testing/.local/share/Trash.test`
</p>

<p class="w3-panel w3-yellow">
  Copy all the files from your regular Trash into the test folder:
</p>

<p class="w3-panel">
  cd $HOME/testing/.local/share/Trash.test<br />
  cp -a $HOME/.local/share/Trash/* .
</p>

<p>Now run 'ls'. You should see 2 directories: files, info</p>

<p>Now 'cd' back to $HOME/testing</p>

<p>Create some unnecessary files.</p>
<p class="w3-panel">
  touch {a..z}
</p>
<p>will create 26 empty files, a-z.</p>

<p class="w3-panel">
  `touch {1..10}`
</p>
<p>will create 10 empty files, 1-10</p>

<p>
  You can now use 'rmw' on these files, or copy real files and
  directories into ~/testing to try it out.
</p>

<h3>Testing the purge feature</h3>
<p>Setting the RMWTRASH environmental variable at run-time to "fake-year"
  will write the year 1999 to the DeletionDate string in the .trashinfo
  file.</p>
<p class="w3-panel">
  RMWTRASH=fake-year rmw some.txt temp.asc files.doc
</p>
<p>Then run rmw with the purge option</p>
<p class="w3-panel">
  rmw -fg
</p>

<h3>Other Environmental Variables</h3>
<p>RMW_TESTBUF e.g. `RMW_TESTBUF=20` will make rmw think the maximum
  allowed string length is 20. As a result, it will test the `bufchk`
  function to make sure it's working as intended. Most strings in the
  program will exceed 20 chars so the `bufchk` function should catch the
  problem.
