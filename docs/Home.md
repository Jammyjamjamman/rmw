# Welcome to the rmw wiki! #

rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a cross-platform command-line "trash can"
utility. It can send files to your "Desktop" trash, or a completely
separate folder; restore files and append a unique string to the
filenames so they won't be overwritten (duplication protection).

* [README.md](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/blob/master/README.md) contains the basics of installing and using rmw for the first time
* [Contributing](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut/rmw/wiki/Contributing) gives instructions on [how to make a pull request and sync your repo](https://github.com/andy5995/rmw/wiki/Contributing#pull-requests), and offers some tips on testing methods.
