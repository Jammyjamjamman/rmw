Description: A "safe-remove" utility for the command line
 rmw (ReMove to Waste) is a cross-platform command-line "trash can"
 utility. It can send files to your "Desktop" trash, or a completely
 separate folder; restore files and append a unique string to the
 filenames so they won't be overwritten (duplication protection).
