# Testing

From the build directory:

    make check

to run the tests. Some of them will use valgrind<http://valgrind.org/>
(if it's installed) and will be very slow. To disable the use of
valgrind:

    USE_VALGRIND=0 make check

Detailed logs for each test will be created in `test/`.

For more information about testing, see the Code Testing
page<https://remove-to-waste.info/code-testing.html> on the rmw
website.
