## Pull Requests ##
1. Join the [chat room](https://matrix.to/#/!XeJxcdkywroPaRKKtr:matrix.org) so if any problems arise, you can get support.
1. [Fork the rmw repo](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut.com/rmw/fork)
2. Clone it to your computer
3. When you're ready to work on an issue, be sure you're on the **master** branch. From there, [create a separate branch](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches) (e.g. issue_32)
4. Make your changes. If you're unsure of some details while you're making edits, you can discuss them with me in the [chat room (Slack workspace)](https://join.slack.com/t/removetowaste/shared_invite/enQtMjU3NTA0NTI2OTgzLTkzMzQxNDhjYzlkM2UxMTA2MzJjNWYyZjAyYzkyNWNmZjJmYWZmYjUyODk2NzNkNzBhMzFjOGZkMTg2MzAxMTM) or the [RMW SourceForge Forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/rmw/discussion/).
5. Commit your changes. [git-cola](https://git-cola.github.io/) is a nice GUI front-end for adding files and entering commit messages (git-cola is probably available from your OS repository).
6. Push the working branch (e.g. issue_32) to your remote fork.
7. Make the pull request (on the [upstream **master** branch](https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut.com/rmw/tree/master))
    * Do not merge it with the master branch on your fork. That would result in multiple, or unrelated patches being included in a single PR.
8. If any further changes need to be made, I will discuss them with you.

## Syncing ##

Periodically, you'll need to sync your repo with the upstream.
GitHub has instructions for doing this

* [Configuring a remote for a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/)
  * For step 3 on that page, use https://github.com/theimpossibleastronaut.com/rmw.git for the URL.
* [Syncing a Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
  * On that page, it shows how to merge the **master** branch (steps 4 & 5).
