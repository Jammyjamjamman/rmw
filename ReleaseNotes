=== RMW Release Notes ===

v0.7.06

  * When using -s,--select, the number of lines the terminal has will
  be checked. The number of items in the list will be based on that; if
  it doesn't meet the minumum requirement, rmw will exit.
  
  * Allow optional argument to -g/--purge that can override the value of
  'purge_after' in the configuration file (-g[N_DAYS], --purge[=N_DAYS]).
  
  * bugfix: restore broken symbolic links instead of giving a "file not
  found" message (issue #292)
  
  * Improved handling of file with leading hyphens
  
  * When an invalid option is given, usage output no longer displays
  
  * You can view how many days remain until a file is purged by using
  -vv (with -fg).
  
  * If lstat() encounters and error, also display the filename/directory it
  was attempting to access.
  
  * add '-m, --most-recent-list' option: list most recently rmw'ed files
